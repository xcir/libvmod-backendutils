FUNCTIONS
============



INSTALLATION
==================

Installation requires Varnish source tree.

Usage::

 ./autogen.sh
 ./configure VARNISHSRC=DIR [VMODDIR=DIR]

`VARNISHSRC` is the directory of the Varnish source tree for which to
compile your vmod. Both the `VARNISHSRC` and `VARNISHSRC/include`
will be added to the include search paths for your module.

Optionally you can also set the vmod install directory by adding
`VMODDIR=DIR` (defaults to the pkg-config discovered directory from your
Varnish installation).

Make targets:

* make - builds the vmod
* make install - installs your vmod in `VMODDIR`
* make check - runs the unit tests in ``src/tests/*.vtc``
